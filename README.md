# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The workflow includes full data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to build a reliable classifier.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Handled imbalanced dataset using resampling and evaluation-focused metrics.
- Performed full **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **EDA**.
- Built and trained a model using **XGBoost** for high accuracy and performance.
- Tuned the model to improve **recall** and **precision** balance.
- Achieved **99% accuracy** on the test set.
- Evaluated the model using **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Saved the trained model using **joblib** for future use and deployment in a web app.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- joblib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, visuals, and explanations.
- `model.pkl` (optional): Saved model using `joblib` (used for deployment).

## 🚀 Deployment (In Progress)

- Streamlit web app version is being developed locally.
- The trained model saved with `joblib` will be loaded in the app for real-time predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

- Dataset used: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
