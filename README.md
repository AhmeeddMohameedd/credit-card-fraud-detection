# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The workflow includes full data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build a reliable fraud detection system.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- Handled highly imbalanced dataset using resampling techniques (e.g., undersampling).
- Performed full **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.
- Trained and compared multiple models, including **XGBoost** and a **Neural Network**.
- Tuned models to improve the balance between **recall** and **precision**, crucial for fraud detection.
- Achieved **99% accuracy** on the test set.
- Evaluated models using **confusion matrix**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Saved the trained model using **joblib** for future deployment in a Streamlit web app.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Keras (for Neural Network)  
- joblib  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb`: Main notebook with full implementation and analysis.
- `model.pkl` (optional): Saved XGBoost or neural network model using `joblib`.

## 🚀 Deployment (In Progress)

- A **Streamlit web app** version is currently under local development.
- The trained model will be integrated for real-time fraud predictions.
